# MarkupBuilder #

Copyright (C) 2015 Magnus Lindberg -- see COPYING

MarkupBuilder is a java API for creating static html content. It aims to provide a simple and intuitive, yet powerful interface
with the ability to chain methods together in a way that makes sense.

Current build is 1.0-SNAPSHOT which means functionality is in no way complete or even working to some extent.

**Current ToDo's**
* Add JavaDoc comments to all files, effectively documenting the whole project.
* Add tests for relevant parts
* Create fully functional implementation
* Get Ant to work again

**Longer term ToDo's/Roadmap**
Support for both html4, html5 and xhtml
